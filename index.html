                Object oriented programming is the most common method of coding today.
                OOP models a system that is a collection of of objects, where each object something in that system.
                for example Java and C++ are both object oreinted programing languages.
                
                     In OOP, Objects are key constructss in our programming, and these objects contain properties and functionality.               
                
                <h4 class="header3">Terminology: - Classes vs. Objects</h4>
                    <p>
                       class - is a blueprint, in which you create your properties and functionality. allow the creation of objects that store internal data, and expose
                       behavior to users of those objects. they also allow private fields, which means data can be hidden from users if
                       Object- is the actual product developed from the blueprint. an object is an instance if a clss.
                       So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class. many use these
                       terms interchangeably. They are sepereate in JavaScript.
                    </p>
                <h4 class="header3">JavaScript and OOP:</h4>  
                    <p>
                        JavaScript has features of those described above; however, as we stated earlier, classes and objects in oop are two seperate constructs. 
                        in JS objects are often created without any seperate class definition, by either using a function or an object literal. Thus,
                        programming objects is mch more light-wieght than in class-based OOP.
                    </p>

                <h4 class="header3"> When to create a new class?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Generally classes are used for one purpose. for example, if you are building a card game program. you would have
                        a class for every aspect. one for the dealer, one for the deck of cards, one for the players in the game, a class with properties and functionalities each designed to
                        function specific to its task. 
                    </p>

                <h2 class="header1">The Four Pillars of OOP</h2>
                <h4 class="header3">Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, & Polymorphism</h4>
                <h4 class="subheading">Abstraction: </h4>
                    <p>
                        Abstraction means to only show the necessary details to the user. 
                        Going back to our car example, we do not need 
                        to know the inner mechanisms of what is going on to turn on the engine. 
                        We just want to push a button or turn the keys to turn the engine on. 
                        Thatâ€™s what abstraction is, we only expose the necessary details 
                        and hiding the irrelevant information. An example in code could be converting a 
                        string to lowercase letters by using .toLowerCase(). We do not need to know how the
                        language does it, we just need the input. This can reduce the complexity of our code.
                    </p>
                <h4 class="subheading">Encapsulation: </h4>
                    <p>
                        this means wrapping up data and methods together into a single unit like a class.
                        it is also built on the idea of data hiding. The variables of a class will be hidden 
                        from other classes and can be accessed only through the methods of thier current class.
                        
                    </p>
                <h4 class="subheading"> Inheritance: </h4>
                    <P>
                        This is key when reusing code in an object-oriented program. It's possible
                        to reuse properties and methods when a new class is created from an existing 
                        class. This is used if you have multiple classes with similar properties. 
                    </P>
