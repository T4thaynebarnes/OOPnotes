          Object oriented programming is the most common method of coding today.
          OOP models a system that is a collection of of objects, where each
          object something in that system. for example Java and C++ are both
          object oreinted programing languages. In OOP, Objects are key
          constructss in our programming, and these objects contain properties
          and functionality.

            <div>
              <h4 class="definition">Classes</h4>
              <p class="words">
                - is a blueprint, in which you create your properties and
                functionality. allow the creation of objects that store internal
                data, and expose behavior to users of those objects. they also
                allow private fields, which means data can be hidden from users
                if
              </p>

              <p class="words">
                - is the actual product developed from the blueprint. an object
                is an instance if a clss. So, a class is a template for objects,
                and an object is an instance of a class. many use these terms
                interchangeably. They are sepereate in JavaScript.

          <h4 class="header3">JavaScript and OOP:</h4>
          <p>
            JavaScript has features of those described above; however, as we
            stated earlier, classes and objects in oop are two seperate
            constructs. in JS objects are often created without any seperate
            class definition, by either using a function or an object literal.
            Thus, programming objects is mch more light-wieght than in
            class-based OOP.
          </p>

          <h4 class="header3">When to create a new class?</h4>
          <p>
            Generally classes are used for one purpose. for example, if you are
            building a card game program. you would have a class for every
            aspect. one for the dealer, one for the deck of cards, one for the
            players in the game, a class with properties and functionalities
            each designed to function specific to its task.
          </p>

          <h2 class="header1">The Four Pillars of OOP</h2>
          <h4 class="header3">
            Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, & Polymorphism
          </h4>
          <h4 class="subheading">Abstraction:</h4>
          <p>
            An abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and
            showing only the functionality to the users. In other words, it
            ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subheading">Encapsulation:</h4>
          <p>
            this means wrapping up data and methods together into a single unit
            like a class. it is also built on the idea of data hiding. The
            variables of a class will be hidden from other classes and can be
            accessed only through the methods of thier current class.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subheading">Inheritance:</h4>
          <p>
            This is key when reusing code in an object-oriented program. It's
            possible to reuse properties and methods when a new class is created
            from an existing class. This is used if you have multiple classes
            with similar properties.
          </p>

          <h4 class="subheading">Polymorphism:</h4>
          <p>
            The polymorphism is a core concept of an object-oriented paradigm
            that provides a way to perform a single action in different forms.
            It provides an ability to call the same method on different
            JavaScript objects. Polymorphism means the same function with
            different signatures is called many times. In real life, for
            example, a boy at the same time may be a student, a class monitor,
            etc. So a boy can perform different operations at the same time.
            This is called polymorphism.
